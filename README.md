# Verilog-Cache
These programs implements a cache (in 4 & 8 bit versions) configured as direct mapped, two-way set associative, and fully associative. 
The program reads a trace file of 100 values from memory and inserts the items into the cache, the program will count the hits and misses and return the total for each cache mapping approach.
